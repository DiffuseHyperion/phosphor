# **Cryptography**

## _Cryptography refers to hiding information or text, where only the intended people with the required knowledge can read it._

Cryptography is a common topic in every CTF, involving you to identify and decrypt messages for your flag.

The key to handling cryptography challenges well is experience.

It is definitely an easy to grasp topic and at the end of this section you should be able to crack simple and intermediate cryptography challenges.

In this chapter, we will go through easy and common ciphers, hashes, and the basics of RSA and XOR.

In the real world, cryptography is used to secure traffic between you and critical services - banking, messaging, internet browsing and more.

Cryptography is a large reason these services can continue to operate today.
