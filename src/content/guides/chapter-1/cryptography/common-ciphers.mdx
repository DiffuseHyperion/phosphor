# **Common Ciphers**

In most beginner cryptography challenges, the difficulty is to identify the cipher used.
While there will definitely be some challenges that use an obscure cipher, most challenges will use a few common ciphers.
It would be invaluable to be able to quickly recognise some ciphers in order to quickly decode your message.

Dcode has a [website](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) that automatically identifies your cipher. It is not perfect, but it might give you a clue.

To decode your message after identifying the cipher, try searching online for an online decoder.

- [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) has multiple decoders for popular ciphers. It also has the ability to automatically decode ciphertexts if it recognises the cipher.

- [Dencode](https://dencode.com/en/) allows you to attempt decoding a ciphertext using multiple ciphers.

<Callout type={"note"}>
    <p>Some ciphers need keys or special options in order to decode your ciphertext. You will need to get this somewhere from the challenge.</p>
    <p>Try to find the key or options in the challenge description, especially if it is longer than usual.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, it is possible to bruteforce the key for some ciphers, especially ROT ciphers.</p>
</Callout>

<Callout type={"info"}>
    <p>A very common cipher used - even outside of cryptography challenges - is Base64.</p>
    <p>Although the example below does not show it, Base64 encoded messages nearly always have "=" characters trailing it.</p>
</Callout>

| Cipher Name | Example Ciphertext (Plaintext: "Hello world!")   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ROT-13      | Uryyb jbeyq! (Note that "!" was not encoded)     |
| ROT-47      | w6==@ H@C=5P                                     |
| Morse       | .... . .-.. .-.. --- .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.-- |
| Base64      | SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh                                 |
| Vignere     | (Key: foobar) Mszmo ntfze!                       |
| Railfence   | (Key: 2, Offset: 0) Hlowrdel ol!                 |
| Keyboard    | (QWERTY, Shift right by 1) Jr;;p ept;f@          |

In reality, these ciphers are rarely used (except Base64, you will definitely see it in future guides). These ciphers are unlikely to show up in more advanced CTfs, but picking up these ciphers are good for your first few CTFs.
