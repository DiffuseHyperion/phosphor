# **RSA**

RSA stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman. It is a cipher that is still used to this very day.

So far, the [ciphers you learnt so far](/docs/chapter-1/cryptography/common-ciphers) are called "symmetric ciphers". These ciphers use the same algorithm to encode and decode a message,
and you can decrypt a ciphertext as long as you have the same keys/options used to encrypt it.

However, RSA is an "asymmetric cipher". These ciphers make use of multiple keys, one for encrypting and one for decrypting a message.

The key used to encrypt the plaintext is called the "public key", while the key used to decrypt the ciphertext is called the "private key".
As the name suggests, public keys are meant to be accessible to everybody, while private keys should be kept a secret, away from attackers.

In CTFs, questions involving RSA usually require you to recover the private key to an encrypted message.

### Calculating a key

| Variable | Description                   | Privacy |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------|
| c        | Ciphertext                    | Public  |
| p        | Prime number 1                | Private |
| q        | Prime number 2                | Private |
| n        | p * n                         | Public  |
| e        | Integer, usually 65537        | Public  |
| d        | Bunch of math from p, q and e | Private |

Usually in a challenge, you will be given `c`, `n` and `e`. Your job is to somehow get `d` in order to decode `c`.
