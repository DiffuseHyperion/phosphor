# **Cryptography**

#### _Cryptography refers to hiding information or text, where only the intended people with the required knowledge can read it._

In essence, you use cryptography to communicate secretly with someone else.
In order to achieve this, you would **"encrypt"** a message, making it unreadable to everybody. The resulting encrypted message is called the **"the ciphertext"**.

When your recipient receives your ciphertext, they would **"decrypt"** your ciphertext in order to read your original message, called the cipher **"text"**.
The method of encrypting/decrypting a message is called a **"cipher"**, and some ciphers utilize another message/value called the **"key"**.

In the context of CTFs, you will be trying to decrypt a ciphertext into its plaintext in order to get your flag.

In the real world, cryptography is used to secure traffic between you and critical services - banking, messaging, internet browsing and more.
Cryptography is a large reason these services can continue to operate today.
