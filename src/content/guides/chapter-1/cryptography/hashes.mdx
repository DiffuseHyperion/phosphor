# **Hashes**

Not all ciphertexts are made to be decrypted! We usually call these ciphertexts "hashes", and the corresponding ciphers are called "hash algorithms".

All hash algorithms should be:
- "Chaotic", where they will produce a completely different result on the slightest change to the plaintext.
- "Collision resistant", where "hash collisions", which is 2 plain text having the same hash, should not happen.
- "Deterministic", where the same plain text should always have the same hash.

| Algorithm Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MD5            | The fastest algorithm among the three, but also not collision resistant.                                                                                                    |
| SHA1           | The second fastest algorithm among the three, but also not collision resistant.                                                                                             |
| SHA-2          | A grouping of multiple hash algorithms, including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.<br/>The slowest among the three but is collision resistant. |

However, just because a cipher was made to be un-decryptable, it does not mean that you can’t!

Since hash algorithms are deterministic, it is possible to prepare a table containing precomputed hashes of common passwords, or really any string. Then, we can compare the hash we want to decrypt to this table, finding out the resulting plaintext. Such a table is called a rainbow table.

A popular rainbow table searcher website is called [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/).

## **Salts**

One way to mitigate rainbow tables is to utilise salts.

Let's create a salt called “foobar”.
We can now add this salt to the end of our plaintext. If we want to hash “Hello world!”, our plaintext with the salt might be “Hello world!foobar”.
Salts don’t have to be added to the end of the original plaintext, but it is the easiest and most common way.

Hashing “Hello world!foobar” with the MD5 hash algorithm would give us “9eea7c53efe4571fec80019633766b9f”.
We see that no results pop up in CrackStation now.

It is important to create a sufficiently random salt. Otherwise, the new hash risks the chance of being pre-computed.
