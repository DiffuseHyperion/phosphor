# **Introduction**

Before you get started, it is important to get you ready for your first CTF!

Bringing just a computer will only get you so far, as CTFs will require special tools in order to solve certain challenges.

The easiest way to get started is to download and run a Virtual Machine. You are going to be running a Virtual Machine running an Operating System called Kali Linux. Kali Linux is a popular Operating System for cybersecurity experts as it comes preinstalled with many popular tools. Most of these tools will definitely be used in this document and your upcoming CTF. Thus, it is strongly advised to set up a Virtual Machine!

First off, you need to download a Hypervisor. There are 4 options:
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
  - Easiest to set up
  - Alright performance
  - Very friendly user interface
  - Quite configurable
  - A lot of community support
- [VMWare Workstation 17](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/17_0) (Windows, Linux)
  - Slightly harder to set up
  - Arguably better performance
  - Slightly more complex user interface
  - Very configurable
  - A lot of community support
- Hyper-V (Windows 10/11 Pro)
  - Quite hard to set up
  - Very restrictive on what it can run on - only on Windows PRO edition (HOME edition will not work!)
  - Arguably best performance
  - Slightly more complex user interface
  - Somewhat configurable
  - Sizable community support
- QEMU (Windows, MacOS, Linux) (Not recommended, please research/google on your own)

If you just want to quickly set up a Virtual Machine, your best bet is VirtualBox for its easy-to-use interface and its compatibility with many Operating Systems, along with a large amount of community guides and support.

To begin, click on the respective guide to the hypervisor you will be using:
