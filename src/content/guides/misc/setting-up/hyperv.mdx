# **Hyper-V Setup**

1. Hyper-V needs to be turned on. The steps to do so are dependent on the version of Windows that you are using. If you are…
    1. …using Windows 10:
        1. Searching “Windows Powershell” and running it as Administrator
            ![Highlighting the Windows Powershell option](/content/guides/misc/setting-up/hyperv/step1ai.png)
        2. Pasting and entering: <Code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All</Code>
        3. Rebooting your computer by entering Y.
    2. …using Windows 11:
        1. WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
2. Install a pre-built Virtual Machine from Kali Linux’s website. A pre-built Virtual Machine in this case is a Virtual Machine that already has the Operating System installed - you only need to log in once the Virtual Machine is running for the first time!
    1. As of writing this, the latest version is 2023.4 and you can find the pre-built Virtual Machine here.
3. Extract the contents of the file.
    1. You may need to install 7-zip to extract the files. Simply download the installer and go through it.
    2. Right-click the file > 7-Zip > Extract Here

4. Open the extracted folder and run “install-vm.bat”.
5. Search and run “Hyper-V Manager”.

6. You should already see your Virtual Machine within the manager. Double click to open the Virtual Machine.

7. You should see a new window popping up. Click the start button.

8. You should see a popup asking for the display resolution. I recommend you make it full screen by dragging the slider all the way to the right.

9. You should see a login page. Login with the user “kali” and the password “kali”.
    1. Don’t touch “Session”.

10. You have successfully set up your first Virtual Machine! (welcome message not included)
